Welcome to Tetris.
The rules of the game are simple. Try to align the blocks
to form a perfect horizontal line. If a horizontal line
forms, that line disappears.
=> Use 'W' button to change the orientation of the blocks
=> Using 'A' and 'D' to move the block right and left.
=> Use 'X' to end the game.

Defeat: The game ends if a vertical line of block pieces
forms which touches the upper edge of the board!

Good Luck! Have Fun!
